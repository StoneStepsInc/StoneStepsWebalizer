/// @brief  A download job node.
///
/// A download job is a download name tracked for a specific visitor identified
/// by an IP address. A download job may be executed one or more times for its
/// visitor, which is reflected as a download count for this download job.
///
/// Another way to look at download jobs is to 
///
/// For example, if there are two files posted for a download, `a.zip` and `b.zip`
/// and they correspond to download names `A` and `B`, respectively, and if `a.zip`
/// was downloaded twice by a visitor `X` and `b.zip` was downloaded once by the
/// visitor `X` and twice by a visitor `Y`, then there will be three download jobs
/// - `{A, X}`, `{B, X}` and `{B, Y}`, and five downloads - `2 + 1 + 2`.
///
/// Only one download may be in progress (active) for each download job, which is
/// tracked by an instance of an active download node (`danode_t`), which is owned
/// by the download job and will be deleted with the download job node.
///
/// A download job node with a non-empty name must be associated with a host node
/// one way ot another. In the most common case both nodes exist in their hash tables
/// and the download job reference count in the host node reflects the number of
/// download job nodes pointing to this host, which prevents host nodes with non-zero
/// reference counts from being swapped out. However, it is also possible to read a
/// download node and the associated host node from the database into local vatiables,
/// in which case the download job node will not be set up automatically to point to
/// the host node because having a pointer to an address of what could be a local
/// variable is very error-prone, and instead the function using these local variables
/// should call `set_host` to link both nodes and should arrange that the download
/// node is destroyed first.
