/// @brief  A collection of fields extracted from a single log file line
///
/// 1. URL strings can only contain ASCII characters. Non-ASCII characters must be 
/// converted to UTF-8 before they are percent-encoded. However, some applications
/// in the past used arbitrary character encodings before percent-encoding characters,
/// which may lead to bad characters. For example, the JavaScript escape() function
/// encodes the copyright symbol as %A9 (Latin1) instead of %C2%A9 (UTF-8). If a URL 
/// containing such Latin1 character is found in the log, it cannot be interpreted 
/// as a UTF-8 character sequence.
///
/// 2. User agent string consists of product name and version characters, which are
/// expected to contai only ASCII characters. Product comments in parentheses, on the 
/// other hand, may contain practically any characters. However, RFC-2616 specifies 
/// that if any of these characters are not Latin1 characers, they are expected to be 
/// encoded as specified in RFC-2047 (i.e. =?charset?encoding?text?=). The latter is 
/// not interpreted in any way in this code.
///
/// 3. It is not clear what character set is used for user identification.
///
