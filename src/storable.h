/// @brief  Maintains storage flags on behalf of the underlying data object.

/// @tparam object_t An underlying data object class name.
///
/// This object derives from an underlying data object, so it is possible to separate the 
/// underlying object data from storage information, which in turn allows us to pass a 
/// reference to a `const` underlying data object into storage functions and a reference 
/// to a non-`const` storage information object. For example:
/// ```
///     // read X from storage and update storage flags within storable_t
///     void read_from_storage(storable_t<X>& x);
///
///     // write X to storage and update flags in storage_info_t
///     void write_to_storage(const X& x, storage_info_t& xsi);
///
///     storable_t<X> obj_x;
///
///     read_from_storage(x);
///     // ... use and modify x ...
///     write_to_storage(x, x.storage_info);
/// ```
/// Keeping storage information in `storage_info`, as opposed to keeping it in `storable_t`, 
/// makes a clear cut between the underlying data object and `storable_t`. If storage flags
/// were in `storable_t`, the example above wouldn't work.
///
/// We need to define bodies of all copy and move constructors because VC++ 2015 and 2017 
/// fail to compile multiple defaulted copy and move constructors.
///
/// The copy constructor that takes a reference to a non-`const` storable object is needed
/// because otherwise the template constructor is called and copy semantics are not followed.
